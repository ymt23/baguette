# Touches & edge gestures

Coordinate input on iOS 26 / Xcode 26 — taps, swipes, streaming
single-finger touches, and the home-indicator system gestures
(swipe-to-home, app switcher). All of them go through one dispatch:
`IOHIDDigitizerDispatch`.

`IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent` — the path most public bridges
target — has a regression on Xcode 26: bare mouse-event taps either
get misinterpreted as the home gesture or silently drop. Our fix
doesn't try to coax that wrapper. We feed the simulator a real
`IOHIDEvent` shaped exactly like a hardware touch, run it through
`IndigoHIDMessageForTrackpadEventFromHIDEventRef`, and patch two
byte slots the SimulatorKit wrapper leaves uninitialised.

If you're routing hardware buttons (home / lock / power / volume /
action) that's a separate path — see
[buttons.md](buttons.md). Anything that travels as `tap` / `swipe` /
`touch1-*` / `swipe-to-app-switcher` / `swipe-to-home` lives here.
(The `app-switcher` button itself rides the home-button event source —
two `IndigoHIDMessageForButton` presses ~150 ms apart — so it lives in
[buttons.md](buttons.md), not on the digitizer dispatch path.)

## Three entry points, one dispatch

| Surface | How it arrives |
|---------|----------------|
| **CLI** | `baguette tap --x … --y …`, `baguette swipe …`, `baguette press --button swipe-to-app-switcher / swipe-to-home / pull-down-to-lock-screen / pull-down-to-notification-center` (the canned `app-switcher` button uses the home-press recipe — see [buttons.md](buttons.md)) |
| **Wire** | `{"type":"tap"}` / `{"type":"swipe"}` / `{"type":"touch1-down","edge":"bottom",…}` on `baguette serve` WS or `baguette input` stdin. `edge` accepts `bottom` (home / app switcher) or `top` (lock screen / notification center). |
| **Browser** | Click / drag on the focus-mode canvas. Drag from the bottom 7 % streams `touch1-*` with `edge: 'bottom'` (iOS animates the home / app-switcher preview live); drag from the top 7 % streams with `edge: 'top'` (iOS pulls the lock-screen cover sheet from a top-left origin or Notification Center from a top-right origin). |

Everything ends up in `Input.touch1(phase:at:size:edge:)` (streaming)
or in the `IndigoHIDInput` button cases for the canned
`swipe-to-app-switcher` / `swipe-to-home` / `pull-down-to-lock-screen` /
`pull-down-to-notification-center` shortcuts. From there the
`IOHIDDigitizerDispatch.send(...)` helper builds + patches +
dispatches a single touch event.

## The recipe

Five steps. Each one is empirically verified — skip any of them and
iOS either ignores the touch or `backboardd` crashes. Code lives in
`Sources/Baguette/Infrastructure/Input/IOHIDDigitizerDispatch.swift`.

### 1. Build a digitizer-finger event

```swift
IOHIDEventCreateDigitizerFingerEvent(
    nil, mach_absolute_time(),
    /*index*/ 0, /*identifier*/ id,
    /*eventMask*/ phase.eventMask,    // 0x07 down/move, 0x06 up
    x, y, 0.0,                         // normalised coords
    /*tipPressure*/ 0.0, /*twist*/ 0.0,
    /*range*/ phase.range, /*touch*/ phase.touch,
    /*options*/ 0
)
```

`eventMask` is a bitmask from `IOHIDFamily/IOHIDEvent.h`:

```
Range = 0x01   Touch = 0x02   Position = 0x04   Stop = 0x08
Peak  = 0x10   Identity = 0x20  Attribute = 0x40  Cancel = 0x80
```

Down + move use `0x07` (Range | Touch | Position) so iOS sees a
sustained touch with each event; up uses `0x06` (Touch | Position)
to signal lift. `tipPressure` stays at `0.0` — non-zero crashed the
simulator's HID processor in early probes.

### 2. Wrap in a digitizer-parent event

`IOHIDEventCreateDigitizerEvent` (transducer = Finger) → append the
finger as a child via `IOHIDEventAppendEvent`. Real iOS touches
arrive as parent + child IOHIDEvent pairs; a bare finger event
makes the SimulatorKit wrapper produce a 192-byte stub iOS ignores.
Parent + child produces a 384-byte two-record message that matches
the layout `IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent` writes for working
taps.

### 3. Run through the trackpad wrapper

```swift
IndigoHIDMessageForTrackpadEventFromHIDEventRef(parent)
```

`SimulatorKit.framework` exports three `*FromHIDEventRef` wrappers:

| Wrapper | Accepts digitizer events? |
|---------|---------------------------|
| `IndigoHIDMessageForPointerEventFromHIDEventRef`  | ❌ rejects |
| `IndigoHIDMessageForScrollEventFromHIDEventRef`   | untested |
| `IndigoHIDMessageForTrackpadEventFromHIDEventRef` | ✅ — what we use |

The trackpad path was the missing piece: it's the only wrapper that
accepts an `IOHIDEvent` of digitizer type and emits a structured
two-record Indigo message instead of returning `nil`.

### 4. Patch four byte slots

The wrapper leaves two fields uninitialised. iOS reads both; without
the patch the message arrives in an unconsumed channel and gets
dropped silently (visible as `dispatched: true` followed by no
visible reaction).

| Offset | Patch | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `0x6c` (record 1) | `0x32` (UInt32) | `IndigoHIDTouchTarget` — routing tag iOS reads to send the touch to the digitizer subsystem |
| `0x10c` (record 2) | `0x32` | same target, mirrored on the child record |
| `0x3a` (record 1) | `0x04` (UInt8) when any edge bit is set, else `0x00` | "edges-present" flag |
| `0x3b` (record 1) | edge bitmask (UInt8) | left=`0x02`, right=`0x04`, top=`0x08`, **bottom=`0x01`**, none=`0x00` |
| `0xda` / `0xdb` (record 2) | mirror of 0x3a / 0x3b | same edge encoding on the child record |

The bitmask values were derived empirically by sweeping `edge=0..4`
through `IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent`'s 7-arg shape and diffing
the produced bytes — see the `--compare-with-mouse` flag on the
`diag-digitizer-trackpad` probe.

### 5. Dispatch

`SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient.send(message:freeWhenDone:completionQueue:completion:)`
— the same selector the button code already uses for home / lock.
Same-channel dispatch; the dispatch itself is not the hard part,
the message contents are.

## Phases

`IOHIDDigitizerDispatch.Phase` covers a touch sequence:

| Phase | `eventMask` | `range` | `touch` | When |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|------|
| `down` | `0x07` (Range \| Touch \| Position) | `true`  | `true`  | initial press |
| `move` | `0x07` (sustained)                  | `true`  | `true`  | every position update during the drag — keeping Touch on prevents iOS from interpreting the move as a fresh tap |
| `up`   | `0x06` (Touch \| Position)           | `false` | `false` | finger lift |

A tap is `down → hold → up` at the same point. A swipe is
`down → N interpolated moves → up`. Identifiers are sticky on `down`
and reused until `up`, so iOS sees one continuous touch across the
chain.

## Edge gestures

`IOHIDDigitizerDispatch.Edge` flips the matching edge bit on every
event in a sequence: bottom = `0x01`, left = `0x02`, right = `0x04`,
top = `0x08` (with the "edges-present" flag `0x04` at offset `0x3a`).
This is the flag the simulator's system-gesture recognizers check to
decide whether a touch is an interior pan or a system-gesture
candidate.

iOS itself discriminates between gestures purely by velocity, dwell,
and start-x — *we don't* run a client-side discriminator. Same UX as
Simulator.app:

| Gesture | Dispatch shape |
|---------|----------------|
| **Quick flick up** from `y ≈ 1.0` to `y ≈ 0.3` over ~12 × 16 ms steps with `edge=bottom` | iOS fires Home — back to the home screen |
| **Slow drag up** from `y ≈ 1.0` to `y ≈ 0.58` over ~30 × 35 ms steps + ~900 ms dwell at midpoint with `edge=bottom` | iOS fires App Switcher — multitasking cards |
| **Slow drag down** from `(0.25, 0.0)` to `(0.25, 0.55)` over ~24 × 25 ms steps with `edge=top` | iOS pulls the **Lock Screen** cover sheet down |
| **Slow drag down** from `(0.75, 0.0)` to `(0.75, 0.55)` over ~24 × 25 ms steps with `edge=top` | iOS opens **Notification Center** |

All four shapes are exposed as wire buttons:

```
baguette press --button swipe-to-app-switcher
baguette press --button swipe-to-home
baguette press --button pull-down-to-lock-screen
baguette press --button pull-down-to-notification-center
```

The canonical `app-switcher` button doesn't live on this gesture
path — it dispatches as two `IndigoHIDMessageForButton` home presses
~150 ms apart instead (cleaner and more reliable on Face ID
iPhones; see [buttons.md](buttons.md)).

The browser canvas auto-detects edge drags on mousedown — bottom
band (`y / r.height ≥ 0.93`) streams with `edge: "bottom"`; top
band (`y / r.height ≤ 0.07`) streams with `edge: "top"`. Both
switch to live `touch1-*` streaming at the user's actual drag
speed. iOS animates the corresponding system preview (home-card
for bottom, lock-screen cover sheet or notification center for
top) live as the cursor moves — no client-side buffering, no
canned playback on release.

## Wire JSON

### Tap

```json
{ "type": "tap", "x": 220, "y": 480, "width": 440, "height": 956 }
```

### Swipe (one-shot, with interpolation done server-side)

```json
{
  "type": "swipe",
  "startX": 220, "startY": 800,
  "endX":   220, "endY":   200,
  "width":  440, "height": 956,
  "duration": 0.25
}
```

### Streaming touch1 with edge

```json
{ "type": "touch1-down", "x": 220, "y": 950, "width": 440, "height": 956, "edge": "bottom" }
{ "type": "touch1-move", "x": 220, "y": 700, "width": 440, "height": 956, "edge": "bottom" }
{ "type": "touch1-move", "x": 220, "y": 500, "width": 440, "height": 956, "edge": "bottom" }
{ "type": "touch1-up",   "x": 220, "y": 500, "width": 440, "height": 956, "edge": "bottom" }
```

Identifier handling is internal — `IndigoHIDInput` rolls a fresh
identifier on `touch1-down` and reuses it for the chain through
`touch1-up`. `edge` accepts `bottom` / `top` / `left` / `right`;
omit for an interior touch.

### Edge-gesture button shortcuts

```json
{ "type": "button", "button": "swipe-to-app-switcher" }
{ "type": "button", "button": "swipe-to-home" }
```

These run the canned shapes from the table above. Use them when
you don't need live-preview UI feedback (CLI scripts, `baguette
input` stdin) — they're a single dispatch each instead of a chain.

## Where the bytes are decoded

If iOS ever changes any of the layout offsets, the `diag-digitizer-trackpad`
probe is the falsification surface:

```
baguette diag-digitizer-trackpad --udid <UDID> \
    --event-mask 0x07 --range --touch --with-parent \
    --x 0.5 --y 0.5 --dump --compare-with-mouse
```

- `--dump` prints the wrapper output as 16-byte hex rows.
- `--compare-with-mouse` builds the same coords through
  `IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent` (the working tap path) at
  `edge=0` and `edge=3` so you can diff layouts side-by-side.
- `--patch-target` and `--patch-edge bottom|...` toggle the patches
  individually so you can isolate which slot iOS depends on.
- `--cycle` does paired down→up; `--swipe-end-y` does down→N moves
  →up; `--swipe-dwell-ms` adds a midpoint hold.

The probe stays in the build (`Sources/Baguette/App/Commands/DiagDigitizerTrackpadCommand.swift`)
as integration-only research scaffolding. It doesn't sit in any
production path — taps / swipes / touches go through
`IOHIDDigitizerDispatch` directly, not the probe.

## Known limits

- **`touch2-*` (two-finger streaming)** still rides the legacy
  `IndigoHIDMessageForMouseNSEvent` 9-arg signature. Pinch / pan
  with two coincident fingers continues to work via that path; we
  haven't ported it onto the digitizer recipe because the existing
  shape is verified and there's no live-preview feature gated on
  the swap.
- **Edge gesture remapping in landscape** — when the device is
  rotated, the user's *visual* bottom corresponds to a different
  *physical* edge in the portrait coord frame the message uses.
  The browser's orientation transport rotates the `edge` name
  alongside the coords so iOS's gesture recognizer sees a touch +
  edge flag pair on the matching physical edge. Verified mapping
  for a visual-bottom drag: `portrait` → `bottom`,
  `landscape-left` (raw=4) → `right`, `portrait-upside-down`
  (raw=2) → `right`, `landscape-right` (raw=3) → `top`.
  CLI / wire callers passing `edge: bottom` directly while the
  device is rotated will *not* fire the home gesture — they need
  to send the orientation-appropriate edge name from the table
  above, or use the `swipe-to-app-switcher` / `swipe-to-home`
  button shortcuts (which always run their canned shapes from the
  device's portrait bottom regardless of current orientation,
  then iOS handles the rotation internally). The canonical
  `app-switcher` button is rotation-agnostic by design — it's a
  pair of home-button events, no coordinates involved.
- **No carplay / external display targets** — `target = 0x32`
  (touch digitizer) is hard-coded. The dispatch helper would need
  a target parameter to support those, plus a way to route
  through the right `Indigo*Service` warm-up.
