# Hardware buttons

Press-and-release of the physical side buttons on a simulated device:
home, lock, power, volume up / down, and the iPhone 15 Pro's action
button. Three entry points share the same dispatch:

- `baguette press --udid <UDID> --button <name> [--duration <sec>]` — CLI.
- Wire JSON `{ "type": "button", "button": "<name>", "duration": <sec> }`
  on `baguette serve`'s WebSocket and on `baguette input`'s stdin.
- Browser overlay — when `actionable` mode is on, each chrome button
  in the rendered bezel is a real DOM button. Click → tap; click and
  hold → real long-press.

This doc explains the wire surface, the two SimulatorKit code paths
the buttons travel through, and where the magic numbers come from. If
you're routing keyboard input or pointer touches, that's a different
pipeline — see `IndigoHIDInput.swift`'s commentary on the 9-arg mouse
recipe.

## Allowed buttons

| Wire name      | iOS effect                              | Dispatch path |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
| `home`         | Home / app switcher                     | `IndigoHIDMessageForButton` |
| `lock`         | Sleep / wake                            | `IndigoHIDMessageForButton` |
| `power`        | Sleep / wake (modern devices)           | `IndigoHIDMessageForHIDArbitrary` |
| `volume-up`    | Volume up                               | `IndigoHIDMessageForHIDArbitrary` |
| `volume-down`  | Volume down                             | `IndigoHIDMessageForHIDArbitrary` |
| `action`       | iPhone 15 Pro action button             | `IndigoHIDMessageForHIDArbitrary` |
| `app-switcher` | Multitasking carousel (cards)           | `IndigoHIDMessageForButton` × 2 (double home press, ~150 ms apart) |

`siri` is **explicitly rejected**: every Indigo path we tried crashes
`backboardd` on iOS 26.4. Don't add it back without a working recipe.

`app-switcher` is a *virtual* button — there's no physical equivalent
on Face ID iPhones. The dispatch fires two consecutive `home`
`IndigoHIDMessageForButton` messages ~150 ms apart. SpringBoard
listens to that event source independently of whether the device has
home-button hardware, so this recipe is rotation-agnostic and works
across the iPhone X+ family. The slow swipe-and-hold variant is
still available on the wire as `swipe-to-app-switcher` (gesture
path; see [touches.md](touches.md)).

## Wire JSON

```json
{ "type": "button", "button": "action", "duration": 1.2 }
```

- `button` — required. One of the names in the table above.
- `duration` — optional, seconds. `0` (or absent) → ~100 ms tap.
  Non-zero is the down→up hold time; clamped to a 20 ms floor so a
  bogus `0.001` doesn't underrun the simulator's HID dispatch.

The CLI mirrors the wire field: `--duration 1.2` produces the same
effect. HID codes are NOT on the wire — `DeviceButton` is the
rich-domain entity that knows its own standard `(page, usage)` pair
via `standardHIDUsage`, and `IndigoHIDInput` reads it directly. If a
future device ships non-standard codes, edit the switch on
`DeviceButton.standardHIDUsage` rather than threading per-press
overrides through the wire.

## Why duration matters

iOS distinguishes tap vs long-press for almost every side button:

| Button         | Short tap                | Long hold (≥ ~0.8 s)        |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| `action`       | Fires the assigned shortcut | "Hold for Ring" / silent flip |
| `power`        | Sleep / wake             | Siri (≥ ~1.5 s) / Emergency SOS slider (≥ ~5 s) |
| `volume-up`    | Volume up                | Accessibility shortcut       |
| `volume-down`  | Volume down              | Accessibility shortcut       |
| `home`/`lock`  | n/a (already long-press unsafe at the legacy path) | n/a |

The browser overlay measures `mousedown` → `mouseup` and forwards the
elapsed time as `duration`, so holding the cap with the cursor "just
works." Programmatic clients have to pass `duration` themselves —
there's no implicit hold.

## Dispatch — the two paths

`Press.execute(on:)` calls `button.press(duration:on:)`, which
forwards to `Input.button(_:duration:)`. `IndigoHIDInput.button`
switches on the case:

### `home` / `lock` → `IndigoHIDMessageForButton`

Three-arg C function: `(buttonCode, operation, target)`. Codes are
hard-coded to what works on iOS 26.4:

```
home → (0x0, op, 0x33)
lock → (0x1, op, 0x33)
```

`op` is `1` for down, `2` for up — `0` crashes `backboardd`. The
`0x33` is the digitizer routing target. This recipe has been stable
through our test surface; don't generalize it without isolating each
button on a fresh sim.

### `power` / `volume-*` / `action` → `IndigoHIDMessageForHIDArbitrary`

Four-arg C function. The signature is **not** what some open-source
loaders advertise. After reverse-engineering kittyfarm's typedef and
matching it against `nm` output of Xcode 26's `SimulatorKit`:

```c
IndigoHIDMessage* IndigoHIDMessageForHIDArbitrary(
    uint32_t target,    // 0x32 — same digitizer target the mouse path uses
    uint32_t page,      // HID usage page
    uint32_t usage,     // HID usage code
    uint32_t operation  // 1 down / 2 up
);
```

There is **no timestamp argument**. The `KeyboardArbitrary` variant
some loaders use is for HID page 7 (keyboard usages) only; the side
buttons live on pages 11 (telephony) and 12 (consumer), so they need
the generic `HIDArbitrary` symbol.

The pipeline is symmetrical to the legacy path: build a `down`
message, dispatch via `SimDeviceLegacyHIDClient.send`, sleep for the
hold window, build + dispatch an `up` message.

## Where the (page, usage) numbers come from

DeviceKit's `chrome.json` for each device declares the HID
`usagePage` / `usage` next to each button image. Example
(iPhone 12, abridged):

```json
{
  "name": "action",      "usagePage": 11, "usage": 45,
  "name": "volume-up",   "usagePage": 12, "usage": 233,
  "name": "volume-down", "usagePage": 12, "usage": 234,
  "name": "power",       "usagePage": 12, "usage": 48
}
```

`DeviceButton.standardHIDUsage` carries the same values, hardcoded.
chrome.json is consulted for *visual* button placement only — its
HID fields agree with the spec across every iPhone chrome bundle
we've inspected, so we don't read them at dispatch time. If a
future device ships non-standard codes, add a case to
`standardHIDUsage` rather than threading per-press overrides
through the wire.

## Browser overlay

The Baguette SDK's `_Button` part (`Resources/Web/baguette/parts/button.js`)
is the DOM-side renderer. It positions each cap over the bare bezel
using the pre-computed `box` percentages the Swift
`SimulatorDefinition.compose(...)` factory ships on
`/simulators/<UDID>/definition.json`, animates rollover / press states,
and forwards `mouseup` through the SDK transport as a
`{type:"button", button:<name>}` envelope with the real
`mousedown→mouseup` hold time. No HID codes, no chrome lookups, no
geometry math on the client — the rich domain (button identity, HID
resolution, anchor-specific placement) lives entirely in Swift; the
JS sees four CSS-percent numbers and a sprite URL per button.

Buttons whose `name` doesn't map to a known wire button in
`SimulatorDefinition.Button.wireButton(for:)` aren't emitted in the
definition at all — keeps the visual layout honest without rendering
inert caps.

## Adding a new button

1. Extend `DeviceButton` in `Domain/Common/CoordinateTypes.swift` with a
   case whose `rawValue` matches the wire / chrome.json name. Add a
   case to `standardHIDUsage` returning the right `HIDUsage` (or
   `nil` if it routes through the legacy `*ForButton` symbol).
2. Update `Press.allowed` so error messages list it.
3. In `IndigoHIDInput.button(_:duration:)`, decide which arm of the
   switch handles it — legacy (`pressLegacyButton`) or
   arbitrary-HID (`pressArbitraryHID`). If legacy, add a
   `buttonCodes(for:)` entry.
4. Add tests in `Tests/BaguetteTests/Input/GestureTests.swift`
   following the existing `parses <name> button` / DeviceButton
   suite patterns.
5. Map the chrome.json `name` to the wire value in
   `SimulatorDefinition.Button.wireButton(for:)` so the SDK's
   `definition.json` advertises the new button — the JS `_Button`
   part picks it up automatically; no client-side edit needed.

## Known limits

- **`siri`** — every known Indigo path crashes `backboardd` on iOS
  26.4. The button is parseable in chrome.json but unmapped in
  `DeviceButton`; do not add a case until you have a tested recipe.
- **Holds beyond ~5 s** — the dispatch sleep blocks the calling
  thread. Streaming clients should split very long holds into separate
  `down` / `up` events through `touch1` if you need concurrent input
  during the hold.
- **Per-device usage codes** — currently hard-coded to the iPhone
  family's standard HID assignments. Devices with different chrome
  bundles (e.g. CarPlay accessory profiles) would need explicit
  parsing of `chrome.json`'s `usagePage` / `usage`.
