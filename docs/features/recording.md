# Recording

Browser-side capture of the live view (bezel + screen + pinch overlay)
to a WebM/MP4 file. One button in the stream sidebar (and the device-
farm focus pane) toggles it on; clicking again stops, the file shows
up as a download link in the sidebar list.

The recording reuses what the live view already has on the page —
the bezel `<img>` the Baguette SDK loaded, the screen geometry from
the SDK's `SimulatorDefinition.screen` (viewport / rect / clipRadius),
the live decoded canvas StreamSession is painting, and PinchOverlay's
existing dot positions. Nothing extra is fetched or allocated until
Record is pressed.

If you want the end-to-end tap-to-`UITouch` story, read
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md). This doc is scoped to
recording — the architecture, why we settled on a compose canvas
that only exists while recording, and the few non-obvious decisions
worth pinning down.

## Why

Two requests pushed for it:

- **Reproducible bug evidence** — bug reports against simulator builds
  read better with a 10-second clip + visible pinch fingers than a
  static screenshot strip.
- **Demos / asset capture** — the same device-farm sessions used for
  reviews wanted a one-click "save the last minute" affordance.

The constraint was strict: don't disturb the live stream. The streaming
pipeline already runs N hardware H.264 sessions in parallel under the
device farm (one per booted simulator). Adding a server-side recorder
spawned another VT compression session and pushed every device's
frame-delivery off cadence — fixed by moving the whole recording
client-side.

## Surface

```
GET /recorder.js                    — BrowserRecorder module
```

No new server endpoints. The bezel image and screen geometry the
recorder uses are the same `/simulators/:udid/bezel.png` (the bare
variant via `?buttons=false`) and `/simulators/:udid/definition.json`
the SDK already fetches; the recorder doesn't refetch them — it
reuses the references the SDK's `Bezel` part already holds.

## Pipeline

```
Live view (DOM, untouched while idle)
  ├── SDK Bezel: <img bezel> + <div screenArea> + <canvas>
  └── PinchOverlay (SDK gesture): <div container> + <div> dots

   ── Record pressed ──────────────────────────────────────
   ↓
BrowserRecorder.start()
   1. allocate compose canvas at screen.viewport size
   2. start rAF compose loop:
        clearRect
        drawImage(frameImg)                     ← bezel under
        clip(roundRect screen.rect, clipRadius)
          drawImage(sourceCanvas, screen.rect)  ← live frames
          paintOverlayDots(overlayHost)         ← pinch dots
   3. compose.captureStream(60) → MediaRecorder

   ── Stop pressed ───────────────────────────────────────
   ↓
BrowserRecorder.stop()
   1. recorder.stop(), await final chunk
   2. cancel rAF loop, drop compose canvas
   3. blob = new Blob(chunks)
   4. return { url, blob, filename, mimeType, durationSeconds, bytes }
```

When idle (no recording in flight) **nothing extra runs**. No paint
loop, no compose canvas, no extra references held. The live view is
exactly as it always was.

## Why a compose canvas, not a DOM-element capture?

The web platform's `ctx.drawImage` only accepts `<img>`, `<canvas>`,
`<video>`, `ImageBitmap`, and `SVGImageElement`. There's no
"rasterize this DOM subtree" API at video frame rate:

- **`Element.captureStream()`** — doesn't exist.
- **`<foreignObject>` SVG hack** — slow (~30–80 ms/frame), and the
  embedded `<canvas>` inside the foreignObject renders blank.
- **`getDisplayMedia` + Region Capture** — Chrome only, requires a
  permission prompt.
- **`html2canvas`** — same speed/correctness issues as the SVG hack.

But our DOM tree is only three things — a bezel `<img>`, a `<canvas>`,
and a few absolute-positioned dots. drawImage handles the first two
natively and GPU-accelerated. The dots are 4 lines of "read
`element.style.left`, `ctx.arc`". So "copy the DOM into a canvas"
reduces to drawing each layer manually — which is what the compose
loop does.

## Why not server-side?

Earlier server-side iterations didn't pan out:

1. **`ffmpeg -c copy` tap into AVCC** — `H264Encoder` emits SPS/PPS
   only on the first IDR; a recorder attaching mid-stream never saw
   them. The keep-alive pump duplicated the last surface every `1/fps`
   to keep `VideoDecoder` fresh, and `-c copy` propagated those
   duplicates into the MP4 — recording judders even though the source
   is smooth. MJPEG mode had no H.264 to copy at all.
2. **Parallel `Screen` subscription + `AVAssetWriter`** — frame-perfect
   and format-agnostic, but each booted device already runs a VT
   session for its live AVCC stream. Recording adds N+1 simultaneous
   VT sessions; per-session throughput drops, every farm tile stutters.

Browser-side sidesteps both: zero new server-side encode, the
recording matches what the user sees post-bezel, post-overlay.

## BrowserRecorder

```js
const rec = new BrowserRecorder({
  canvas,        // sim.canvas — already painting
  frameImg,      // sim._bezel.frameImg — already loaded
  screen,        // sim.screen.def — SDK SimulatorDefinition.screen
  overlayHost,   // sim.pinchOverlayContainer — already in DOM
  fps: 60,
});
rec.start();
const artifact = await rec.stop();
//   { url, blob, filename, mimeType, durationSeconds, bytes }
rec.cancel();
```

Constructor takes references; nothing is fetched. `start()` allocates
the compose canvas, kicks off the paint loop, and spins up
`MediaRecorder` over `compose.captureStream(fps)`. `stop()` awaits the
final chunk, releases the compose canvas, and returns the artifact.

### MIME type probing

```js
const PREFERRED_MIME_TYPES = [
  'video/mp4;codecs=avc1.42E01E',  // Safari + Chrome (≥113)
  'video/webm;codecs=vp9',         // Chrome + Firefox
  'video/webm;codecs=vp8',         // older browsers
  'video/webm',                    // ultimate fallback
];
```

The first MIME `MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported` accepts wins; falling
through to `''` lets the browser pick its own default.

### Per-frame paint

```js
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, cw, ch);
if (useBezel) {
  ctx.drawImage(frameImg, 0, 0, cw, ch);          // bezel under
  ctx.save();
  roundRectPath(ctx, s.x, s.y, s.width, s.height, r);
  ctx.clip();
  ctx.drawImage(sourceCanvas, s.x, s.y, s.width, s.height);
  paintOverlayDots(ctx, s);                        // dots inside clip
  ctx.restore();
} else {
  ctx.drawImage(sourceCanvas, 0, 0, cw, ch);
  paintOverlayDots(ctx, { x: 0, y: 0, width: cw, height: ch });
}
```

DeviceKit composite PDFs have an opaque dark "off-glass" tint in the
screen rect (designed to sit UNDER live content). Bezel goes first;
screen on top — same z-order the live DOM uses (`screenArea` z-index
2, frameImg z-index 1).

### Pinch overlay copy

```js
const hostRect = overlayHost.getBoundingClientRect();
const sx = screenRect.width  / hostRect.width;
const sy = screenRect.height / hostRect.height;
for (const dot of overlayHost.children) {
  const left = parseFloat(dot.style.left);
  const top  = parseFloat(dot.style.top);
  ctx.arc(screenRect.x + left * sx,
          screenRect.y + top  * sy,
          18 * Math.max(sx, sy),
          0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
}
```

Reads PinchOverlay's existing DOM dots each tick — no caching, no
mutation. Position scaling maps host-local pixels (PinchOverlay's
host element) to composite-canvas coordinates.

### Performance

| phase | per-frame cost | total |
|---|---|---|
| `drawImage(frameImg)` (3.6 MP bitmap blit) | ~0.3 ms | hardware-accelerated |
| `drawImage(sourceCanvas)` clipped | ~0.5 ms | "" |
| 0–2 pinch dots (`arc + fill`) | ~0.05 ms | negligible |
| **per-frame paint total** | **~1 ms** | well under 60 fps budget |
| **idle (not recording)** | **0 ms** | nothing runs |

Recording adds ~6% of one core for the compose loop, plus whatever
the browser's VT/VPx encoder uses (typically hardware). The live
view stays untouched — DOM bezel, DOM PinchOverlay, current paint
cadence.

## Lifecycle on the page

### `sim-stream.js`

```js
const recordingState = {
  recorder, layout,
  active, startedAt, timer, entries,
};
```

`startStream` caches the chrome layout into `recordingState.layout`.
`_simToggleRecord` either constructs a `BrowserRecorder` from the
existing `surface.canvas` / `surface.frameImg` / `pinchOverlay.container`
references and calls `start()`, or stops the active one and pushes
the artifact onto `entries`. `stopStream` cancels any in-flight
recording and revokes Blob URLs to keep long sessions from leaking
memory.

### `farm-focus.js`

The focus pane gets a recorder context closure from FarmApp:

```js
this.focus.show(device, tile, {
  ...,
  getRecorderContext: () => ({
    canvas:      tile?.canvas || null,
    frameImg:    focusScreen?.querySelector('img'),
    screen:      this.definitions.get(udid)?.screen || null,
    overlayHost: tile?.overlayContainer() || null,
  }),
});
```

Re-evaluated on each Record press so a re-focus mid-session can't
strand the recorder on a stale tile. The focus pane owns its own
`recording` state slot.

## Browser support

| browser | container | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome 113+ | MP4 (H.264) or WebM (VP9) | preferred path |
| Safari 14.1+ | MP4 (H.264) | works; isTypeSupported reports MP4 |
| Firefox | WebM (VP9 / VP8) | no MP4 muxer |
| Older / strict CSP | n/a | Record button hides itself when `MediaRecorder` is undefined |

## Testing approach

The recorder is a small JS module wired into two orchestrators
(`sim-stream.js`, `farm-focus.js`). It's exercised manually via the
live UI today; a future iteration could add a thin offscreen-canvas
test (`puppeteer + headless captureStream` works) — not yet in the
repo.

There are no Swift Testing suites for recording: the server isn't
involved.

## Known limits

- **No audio.** SimulatorKit exposes audio through a separate path
  not surfaced here, and recording the simulator's audio output
  would need a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` we don't currently have.
- **Tap rings aren't drawn.** Only pinch / 2-finger gestures populate
  PinchOverlay today, so single taps don't show in the recording.
  Extending PinchOverlay to render a brief auto-fading dot for taps
  is a small follow-up; the recorder picks them up automatically.
- **Long recordings live in RAM.** The Blob accumulates `chunks` until
  Stop. Multi-minute recordings at 1080p are fine; multi-hour ones
  are not.

## Extension points

- **More overlays.** The compose loop is one function per layer;
  adding a frame counter, a watermark, or a region highlight is one
  `ctx.draw…` call away.
- **Bezel toggle on the recorder.** Today the recorder uses bezel
  whenever `frameImg` and a chrome layout are passed. A "record
  without bezel" toggle is a one-line condition in
  `BrowserRecorder._paint`.
- **CLI-issued record trigger.** The browser is the recorder, but a
  WS verb the page listens for (`{type:"record"}` → click the button)
  would let `baguette serve` start recordings remotely without user
  interaction.
